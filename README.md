#  Online Auction Platform

This project is a web-based car auction system that allows users to create, browse, and participate in item auctions. Sellers can post items with detailed characteristics, set closing times, and define hidden reserve prices. Buyers can place manual or automatic bids and receive alerts when outbid or when items of interest become available.

The platform also includes robust browsing and search features, letting users filter and explore auctions by various criteria, view bidding history, and track participation. Admins and customer representatives can manage users, monitor platform activity, and generate detailed sales reports.
